2020-01-00  pending V1.00.2
	* updated configure scripts to handle 2.0.14 via
	  --with-guile=/path/to/guile

2019-12-29  forgot to add for V1.00.1
	* restored code that was commented-out in 1.00.0, so now
	  #if FOO
	  works again when FOO i

2019-12-29  V1.00.1
	* in nyacc/util.scm, changed a letrec* to letrec
	* in nyacc/lang/util.scm, changed a letrec* to let*
	* updated all Makefile.in for autoconf conventions, using
	  abs_top_builddir and abs_top_srcdir
	* added test-suite/Makefile.in to replace lower level versions

2019-12-23  V1.00.0
	* Makefiles now use "$(MAKE)" instead of "make"
	* changed order of udict, ddict arguments to canize-enum-def-list
	* removed hacks from eval-cpp-expr prev used by canize-enum-def-list
	* cleaned up cxeval failures

2019-12-15  V0.99.3
	* in ffi-help.scm, filter "libm" from being added to dynamic-link:
	  on Ubuntu libm.so is a text file which referneces another libm.so;
	  dlopen() does not follow the reference, so just filter out since it
	  is already linked into guile
	* the C parser still breaks where typedefs are used otherwise, like
	    typedef int t; int foo(t *t);  // in libxlsxwriter
	* updated canize-enum-defs to use c99-eval-cx instead of cpp-eval
	  which was a hack; also cleaned up canize to work with comments
	  as attributes instead of elements; added test case

2019-10-23  V0.99.2 release
	* 0.99.1 fix broke things: __extension__ is not function macro
	* ffi-help does not load libm now (ubuntu bug?)

2019-10-19  V0.99.1 release
	* fixed nyacc/lang/c99/util.scm: in c99-def-help function macro
	  aliases changed from "__foo=__foo__" to "__foo(X)=__foo__(X)"

2019-07-20  V0.99.0 release
	* added fixed-point types to C99 parser
	  http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2001/n1290.pdf
	  make-num-reader accepts 0.25hr uhr r ur lr ulr hk uhk k uk lk ulk

	* cleaned up documentation

2019-05-30  V0.94.0 release
	* removed export statment from c99/util.scm

	* started C99 documentation

	* fixed some version number errors

2019-05-30  V0.93.0 release
	* reworked configure and Makefile.in files to detect doc
	  install dirs;
  
	* this CPP feature now works: #define /* hello */ abc 123

	* fixed issue in c99/eval-cpp-incl where #f was ending up in
	  output if no include file found

2019-04-02  V0.92.0 release
	
	* The distribution has been converted to using autoconf, but
	  without automake, which brings in a lot of rubble, IMO.

	* Fixed bug in the ffi-helper that was genering bad code for
	  unions.

2019-01-18  V0.91.0 release

	* module/nyacc/parse.scm (dmsg/n): added ntab information; so
	debug is now more informative:
	OLD:
	  state 99, token 33 => shift, goto 300
	NEW:
	  state 99, token additive-expression => shift, goto 300

	* ffi-help: converting composite literal to constant is no longer
	a fatal error

	* module/nyacc/lang/c99/cxeval.scm (eval-c99-cx): added case for
	comp-lit; made failure throw c99-error instead of calling error

	* module/nyacc/lang/c99/ffi-help.scm: updated error handling when
	cannot convert enum or #defined argument to a constant

2018-11-29  V0.90.0 release

	* module/nyacc/lang/c99/mach.scm (c99-spec): K&R function
	definitions have been removed, since conflict with __attribute__,
	as in: int foo(x) __attribute__ ((__bar__)) int x; { ... };
	Is attribute associated with declarator or declaration-specifiers?

	* update Major overhaul of __attribute__ handling in C99 parser

	* update merged nx-matlab updates from nxdev branch; added fix
	for nyacc/lex.scm to parse #xffff00000


	* update reworked the nyacc parser.scm file (see nyacc/ChangeLog);
	instead of separate parsers for interactive and non-interactive
	there is now one make-lalr-parser with optional #:interactive
	keyword argument; also added #:skip-if-unexp for skipping
	unexpected tokens (e.g., for comments -- this is useful);

	* update moved code from c99/xparser.scm into c99/parser.scm and
	deleted c99/xparser

	* update cleaned up C99 parser set up; the mapping between parse
	tables and the lexical analyzer setup was brittle; cleaned up
	circular dependency between the parser and lexical analyzer using
	letrec; see c99/parser.scm and c99/body.scm

	new release 0.85.0
	* changed the integrated hashed vs unhashed parser was split into
	/sym parsers for unhashed and /num for hashed.
	* updated interactive parsers, getting ready to and integrate file
	and interactive parsers, and overhaul C99 parser setup
