	* module/nyacc/lang/c99/mach.scm (c99-spec): K&R function
	definitions have been removed, since conflict with __attribute__,
	as in: int foo(x) __attribute__ ((__bar__)) int x; { ... };
	Is attribute associated with declarator or declaration-specifiers?

	deleted c99/xparser

	* update cleaned up C99 parser set up; the mapping between parse
	tables and the lexical analyzer setup was brittle; cleaned up

	letrec; see c99/parser.scm and c99/body.scm
