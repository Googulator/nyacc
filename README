There is an incomplete manual in doc/nyacc/.

There are a number of demo programs under examples/nyacc/lang.
For example,
  $ cd examples/nyacc/lang/calc
  $ guile calc1.scm
  2 + 2 => 4

The module code is in module/nyacc.  Modules are imported as follows:
  (use-modules (nyacc lalr))
  (use-modules (nyacc lex))

The syntax and nomenclature should be considered not stable.

The experimental FFI Helper feature requries the bytestructures 
package from:
