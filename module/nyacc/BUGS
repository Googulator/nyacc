BUG-003	<= next bug id

=fixed=	

BUG-001	In lalr.scm, hashify-machine, if pat contains a rrconf then the output
	is unspecified
   todo	I think this was already fixed

BUG-002	If mach has a conflict and hashify followed by pp-lalr-machine then
	error because hashify puts #f, not integer, for pat-v.
  fixed	fixed pp-lalr-machine to check for #f
