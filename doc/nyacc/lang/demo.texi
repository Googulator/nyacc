@section Introduction

Texinfo is a tool for generating software manuals.  Once in a while one
might like to generate a memo with texinfo.  This means no titlepage, 
no chapters, no pagebreaks unless requested, etc.  While a PDF output should
look at described, makeinfo should also work, too.  In addition page
number should appear at the bottom, reference should still work but
having an index probably does not make sense.  More brainstorming to
come.
