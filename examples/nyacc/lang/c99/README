NOTES:

To play with the ffi-helper you need to
  $ . env.sh 
The following generates ffi.d/cairo.scm:
  $ guild compile-ffi ffi.d/cairo.ffi

If you have scheme-bytestructure in your GUILE_LOAD_PATH you can try
  $ guile
  scheme@(guile-user)> ,use (cairo)
Currently the above has unresolved reference (which are new bugs)
