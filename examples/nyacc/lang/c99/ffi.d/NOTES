Missing:
1) Guile does not have some types.  Need the following:
   long long, unsigned long long, intptr_t, uintptr_t
2) Guile does not handle varargs ffi.  I have thoughts on this.
3) bytestructures does not support function declarations.
4) arrays as function args done yet?

To compile a cairo.ffi file execute the following shell command:
  $ guild compile-ffi cairo.ffi

cairo.ffi		running OK now
gdbm.ffi		minior issuses
libgit2.ffi		missing some items
librsvg.ffi		compiles now (was a bear wrt GCC extensions)
sqlite3.ffi		long long int; varargs

rsvg.ffi		to devel/debug #:use-ffi-module (gio gio) etc

glib-object.ffi		filter needs work
gio/gio.ffi		filter needs work
