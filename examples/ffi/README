`guild compile-ffi' can be used to compile .ffi files to .scm and .go:

  $ guild compile-ffi ffi/cairo.ffi
  compiling `cairo.ffi' ...
  ... wrote `cairo.scm'
  compiling `cairo.scm' ...
  ... wrote `cairo.scm.go'


MISSING:
1) some types used in C:
   long long, unsigned long long, intptr_t, uintptr_t, long double
2) patterns for in/out semantics; see http://www.swig.org/article_cpp.html

BROKEN: (still?)
1) struct { char *name; }  =>  (bs:struct `((name (bs:pointer int))))
                           vs  (bs:struct `((name (bs:pointer uint8))))

TODO:
2) move enum comments to ffi.scm comments (currently removed)
3) recheck (pointer-to x) <=> (object-at y)
