To configure:
  $ ./configure
or
  $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/root
or
  $ ./configure --site_scm_dir=/path/to/dest --site_scm_go_dir=/dummy

There is nothing to make:
  $ make
  nothing to make

You can run the tests:
  $ make check
    (cd test-suite/nyacc; \
     make -f Makefile.nyacc GUILE=guile check)
    make[1]: Entering directory ...
    PASS: nyacc/lex-01: C char literals
    PASS: nyacc/lex-01: C strings
    ...


To install only sources in /path/to/dest:
  $ ./configure --site_scm_dir=/path/to/dest --site_scm_go_dir=/dummy
  $ make install-srcs

You must specify site_scm_go_dir to avoid use of `guile'.


If you want to install the experiental FFI Helper files:
  $ make install-ffi-help

The FFI Helper requires the bytestructures package, from
  https://github.com/TaylanUB/scheme-bytestructures
`make install-ffi-helper' will fail if this package is not installed.

See `info ffi-help' for more detail.  Note: compiling the output off the
ffi-helper output of can take some time, due to size.

The file HACKING has hints for modifying and trying code.
