=== To play with example code and try modifications ...

  $ cd examples/nyacc
  $ source env.sh

=== Hacking on the C99 parser ====
To play with the C99 code, in place, I recommend the following:
After sourcing env.sh as above, do

  $ cd lang/c99
  $ guile tryit.scm

If you modify module/nyacc/lang/c99/mach.scm you will need to rebuild the
files in the subdirectory mach.d.  To do this run, in guile, the following:
  (use-modules (nyacc lang c99 mach))
  (use-modules (nyacc lang c99 cppmach))

  (gen-c99-files ".")
  (system "touch ./parser.scm")
  (gen-c99x-files ".")
  (system "touch ./xparser.scm")
  (gen-cpp-files ".")
  (system "touch ./cpp.scm")

Sorry, maybe not all clean, but his is BETAWARE.

=== Javascript parser

This illustrates use of the parser to generate tree-il and run inside guile.
After sourcing env.sh as above, do

  $ guile
  ...
  scheme@(guile-user)> ,L javascript
  Happy hacking with javascript!  To switch back, type `,L scheme'.
  javascript@(guile-user)> var = 1;
  ...
